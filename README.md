**Metro Hustle**

**Main theme**  
The protagonist, an underdog with street smarts, uses metro tracks for deliveries. Because, metro tracks are less monitored compared to above-ground roads. It’s a fast route with predictable schedules. Due to increased security and drone surveillance above ground, running on tracks is the only way to evade authorities. The "not so legal"/blackmarket items he delivers require discretion. So, metro tunnels are perfect for bypassing checkpoints.

**Protagonist's Backstory**  
The protagonist has insider knowledge about metro systems, maybe because he was an ex-rail worker or street kid who grew up around metro stations, we can decide on this later.  
This sets up an "urban survival" theme where the protagonist runs a high-risk, delivery network.

**Storyline: "Metro Hustle"**  
In a near-future, semi-dystopian city, sprawling underground metro systems connect districts where life operates in a gray area of legality. The city above is controlled by corporate monopolies and an authoritarian police state. Goods like banned music devices, rare art, homegrown coffee beans, or bootleg software have become contraband—not illegal, but heavily restricted.

The protagonist, Axel, is a daring runner who grew up in the metro system. He’s known for delivering blackmarket items between districts through the metro tunnels. Axel doesn’t see himself as a criminal, just a survivor, a hustler, and someone the city desperately needs. As Axel progresses, he uncovers a larger conspiracy involving corrupt corporates manipulating the metro system for their gain, forcing him to make choices about survival, rebellion, and justice.

**Game Design**

**Visual Style:** Gritty, neon-lit metro tunnels. Each metro line/station has a unique aesthetic reflecting the city's socio-economic divide, slums, upscale districts, abandoned tunnels, etc.

**Character Design:** Axel, street-smart with a cool, rebellious vibe. Gear upgrades affect his appearance (for example, sneakers for faster runs).

**Enemies**: Metro guards, drones, rival runners.

**Allies**: Hackers, vendors at stations, informants.

**Missions:** Deliver packages across metro stations with increasing challenges.  
Stations are unlockable hubs where Axel interacts with vendors to buy upgrades or black-market tools.

We can also introduce story-based levels involving boss chases, rival runner battles, or avoiding guards patrolling tunnels.

**Gameplay Mechanics**

**Core Gameplay:** Runner Mechanics on Metro Tracks

**Lane Switching:** Like Subway Surfers

**Delivery Management System:**

1. The more goods Axel carries, the slower he runs or the harder it is to dodge obstacles.
2. Players must identify marked drop zones at certain stations to unload goods mid-run. Missing these drop zones increases risk.
3. When carrying fragile items, player must avoid hard jumps and collisions.
4. Some items must be delivered before the timer runs out.

**Stealth and Distraction Mechanics:**  
Guards or drones patrol tunnels or platforms. Instead of always running, Axel can:

1. Throw decoy items (sound-making devices) to distract guards.
1. Hide briefly in maintenance alcoves or behind obstacles.
2. Stealth sections where slowing down and planning your route is critical.

**Train Interaction Mechanic:**

1. Metro trains frequently appear on tracks, forcing Axel to switch lanes, jump onto platforms
2. Axel can climb on top of trains to hitch a ride for a speed boost,  bypass certain obstacles or guards but risks getting hit by tunnel barriers.

**Station Events and Upgrades:**  
After completing runs, players enter "safe zones" which are metro stations, to interact with allies or vendors. There, he can,  
**Upgrade Gear:** Better shoes for speed, bags for carrying more items, or hacking tools for unlocking maintenance tunnels.  
**Accept New Missions:** Choose between easy runs with fewer rewards or high-risk deliveries.

**Parkour System:**  
Axel can vault over barricades, wall-run across gaps, or slide under closing metro doors. Timing and skillful movements earn bonuses.
